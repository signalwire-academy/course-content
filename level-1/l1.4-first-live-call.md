**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Module:** M1.4 - Exposing Agents

## Objectives

- Set up ngrok tunnel
- Configure basic authentication
- Connect SignalWire phone number
- Make first live call to your agent

## Prerequisites

- Completed Labs 1.1-1.2
- ngrok installed and authenticated
- SignalWire account with phone number
- Phone to make test calls

---

## Exercise 1: Prepare Your Agent

Create a production-ready agent:

**Create `live_agent.py`:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Agent ready for live calls."""

import os
from signalwire_agents import AgentBase

agent = AgentBase(
    name="live-agent",
    route="/agent"
)

# Basic authentication
auth_user = os.getenv("AUTH_USER", "signalwire")
auth_pass = os.getenv("AUTH_PASS", "training123")

agent.set_params({
    "swml_basic_auth_user": auth_user,
    "swml_basic_auth_password": auth_pass,
})

# Prompt
agent.prompt_add_section(
    "Role",
    "You are a friendly training assistant for SignalWire. "
    "Greet callers warmly and have a brief conversation. "
    "Ask them what they're learning about today."
)

agent.prompt_add_section(
    "Guidelines",
    bullets=[
        "Keep responses brief - this is a phone call",
        "Be enthusiastic about voice AI",
        "If asked about SignalWire, say you're a demo agent"
    ]
)

# Voice
agent.add_language(
    "English",
    "en-US",
    "rime.spore",
    speech_fillers=["One moment...", "Let me think..."]
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()
```

**Test locally:**

```bash
swaig-test live_agent.py --dump-swml
```

---

## Exercise 2: Start Agent Server

Run your agent:

```bash
python live_agent.py
```

**Keep this terminal running!**

**Verify it's working:**

```bash
# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:3000/agent
```

You should see SWML JSON.

---

## Exercise 3: Start ngrok Tunnel

In a new terminal:

```bash
# Option A: Random URL
ngrok http 3000

# Option B: Static domain (if you have one)
ngrok http 3000 --domain=your-name.ngrok-free.app
```

**Record your forwarding URL:**

```text
Forwarding URL: https://_________________.ngrok.io
```

---

## Exercise 4: Test Tunnel

Verify the tunnel works:

```bash
# Without auth (should fail)
curl https://YOUR-URL.ngrok.io/agent
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# With auth (should work)
curl https://signalwire:training123@YOUR-URL.ngrok.io/agent
# Expected: SWML JSON
```

**Checkpoint:** Both tests behave as expected.

---

## Exercise 5: Configure SignalWire

1. Log in to SignalWire dashboard
2. Navigate to **Phone Numbers**
3. Click on your phone number
4. Find **Voice and Fax Settings**
5. Configure:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Handle calls using | SWML Script |
| URL | `https://signalwire:training123@YOUR-URL.ngrok.io/agent` |
| HTTP Method | POST |

1. Click **Save**

**Important:** Replace `YOUR-URL` with your actual ngrok URL!

---

## Exercise 6: Make Your First Call

**Preparation Checklist:**

- [ ] Agent running in terminal 1
- [ ] ngrok running in terminal 2
- [ ] SignalWire configured with your URL

**Make the Call:**

1. Call your SignalWire phone number
2. Wait for your agent to answer
3. Have a brief conversation
4. Hang up when done

**What to Try:**

- Say "Hello"
- Ask "What can you do?"
- Ask "What am I learning today?"

---

## Exercise 7: Monitor the Call

While calling, watch:

**Terminal 1 (Agent):**

```text
INFO:     POST /agent HTTP/1.1 200 OK
INFO:     POST /agent/swaig HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

**Terminal 2 (ngrok):**
Shows requests coming through the tunnel.

**ngrok Inspector:**
Open <http://127.0.0.1:4040> to see:

- Request details
- Response bodies
- Timing information

---

## Exercise 8: Troubleshooting Practice

If your call didn't work, diagnose:

**Step 1: Agent running?**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/agent
```

Should return SWML.

**Step 2: ngrok tunnel working?**

```bash
curl https://YOUR-URL.ngrok.io/agent
```

Should return 401 (auth required).

**Step 3: Auth correct?**

```bash
curl https://signalwire:training123@YOUR-URL.ngrok.io/agent
```

Should return SWML.

**Step 4: SignalWire URL correct?**
Double-check the URL in SignalWire dashboard.

**Common Issues:**

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No answer | Agent not running | Start agent |
| Fast busy | ngrok down | Restart ngrok |
| "Cannot connect" | Wrong URL | Fix SignalWire URL |
| Silence | Auth failed | Check credentials |

---

## Exercise 9: Make Changes Live

**Without stopping anything:**

1. Edit `live_agent.py`
2. Change the prompt
3. Save the file

**Hot reload:**

- The agent auto-reloads on file change
- Call again to hear the new behavior

**Try changing:**

- Greeting style
- Voice (try `rime.marsh`)
- Filler phrases

---

## Exercise 10: Clean Shutdown

Proper shutdown sequence:

1. Press `Ctrl+C` in agent terminal
2. Press `Ctrl+C` in ngrok terminal
3. Update SignalWire to remove URL (or leave for later)

---

## Deliverables

Record and submit:

1. Screenshot of ngrok running
2. Screenshot of SignalWire configuration
3. Brief notes on your conversation with the agent

---

## Review Questions

1. Why do we need ngrok for development?
2. What does the authentication protect against?
3. What URL format includes credentials?
4. How do you debug when calls don't work?
5. What happens when you change the agent while running?

---

## Summary

You have successfully:

1. Prepared an agent for live calls
2. Set up ngrok tunnel
3. Configured authentication
4. Connected SignalWire phone number
5. Made your first live AI call!

**Congratulations!** You've completed the core Day 1 objectives.

**Next:** Day 2 - Prompt Engineering and Functions
