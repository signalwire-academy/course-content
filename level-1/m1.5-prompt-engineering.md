## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Use the Prompt Object Model (POM) effectively
- Structure prompts with sections and subsections
- Write voice-optimized prompts
- Design consistent agent personalities

## Topics

### 1. Prompt Object Model (POM) (30 min)

#### What is POM?

The Prompt Object Model is a structured way to build prompts:

```python
# Instead of one giant string...
prompt = "You are a helpful agent. Be polite. Ask for name first..."

# Use structured sections
agent.prompt_add_section("Role", "You are a helpful agent.")
agent.prompt_add_section("Behavior", "Be polite and professional.")
agent.prompt_add_section("Process", "Always ask for the caller's name first.")
```

#### Why Structure Matters

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Giant string | Hard to maintain, modify, read |
| POM sections | Organized, modular, clear |

#### Generated Output

POM creates markdown-formatted prompts:

```markdown
# Role
You are a helpful agent.

# Behavior
Be polite and professional.

# Process
Always ask for the caller's name first.
```

### 2. Section Types (25 min)

#### Basic Sections

```python
agent.prompt_add_section(
    "Role",                           # Section title
    "You are a customer service agent for Acme Corp."  # Body text
)
```

#### Sections with Bullets

```python
agent.prompt_add_section(
    "Guidelines",
    body="Follow these rules:",
    bullets=[
        "Be concise - phone conversations should be brief",
        "Confirm understanding by repeating key details",
        "Never make promises you can't keep"
    ]
)
```

**Generates:**

```markdown
# Guidelines
Follow these rules:
- Be concise - phone conversations should be brief
- Confirm understanding by repeating key details
- Never make promises you can't keep
```

#### Subsections

```python
agent.prompt_add_section("Personality")

agent.prompt_add_subsection(
    "Personality",
    "Tone",
    "Warm and friendly, but professional"
)

agent.prompt_add_subsection(
    "Personality",
    "Language",
    "Use simple words, avoid jargon"
)
```

**Generates:**

```markdown
# Personality

## Tone
Warm and friendly, but professional

## Language
Use simple words, avoid jargon
```

---

### 3. Voice-Optimized Writing (30 min)

#### Text vs Voice

**Written (bad for voice):**
> "Please navigate to the settings menu, click on 'Account', then select 'Change Password' from the dropdown."

**Voice (good):**
> "Go to Settings, then Account, then Change Password."

#### Voice Writing Rules

| Rule | Written | Voice |
|------|---------|-------|
| Short sentences | Long, complex | Brief, direct |
| Numbers | "15" | "fifteen" |
| Acronyms | "API" | "A P I" or spell out |
| Punctuation | Commas, semicolons | Natural pauses |
| Lists | Numbered bullets | "First... Second..." |

#### Prompt Example

**Bad (written style):**

```python
agent.prompt_add_section(
    "Role",
    "You are an AI-powered customer service representative employed by "
    "Acme Corporation (NYSE: ACME), a Fortune 500 company specializing in "
    "consumer electronics, home appliances, and related accessories. Your "
    "primary responsibilities include, but are not limited to: handling "
    "customer inquiries, processing returns (subject to our 30-day policy), "
    "and escalating complex issues to Tier 2 support."
)
```

**Good (voice style):**

```python
agent.prompt_add_section(
    "Role",
    "You are a customer service agent for Acme. "
    "You help with questions, returns, and support issues."
)

agent.prompt_add_section(
    "Key Info",
    bullets=[
        "Returns are accepted within 30 days",
        "Complex issues go to a specialist",
        "You cannot process payments directly"
    ]
)
```

### 4. Personality Design (20 min)

#### Personality Components

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Tone | How they sound | Friendly, professional, casual |
| Vocabulary | Word choice | Simple, technical, formal |
| Pacing | Conversation speed | Quick, measured, patient |
| Empathy | Emotional response | Acknowledge feelings, stay neutral |

#### Example: Professional Support Agent

```python
agent.prompt_add_section(
    "Personality",
    body="You are professional and helpful.",
    bullets=[
        "Use a warm but businesslike tone",
        "Be patient with confused callers",
        "Show empathy when customers are frustrated",
        "Stay positive and solution-focused"
    ]
)
```

#### Example: Casual Concierge

```python
agent.prompt_add_section(
    "Personality",
    body="You are friendly and approachable.",
    bullets=[
        "Use casual language, like talking to a friend",
        "It's okay to use phrases like 'awesome' and 'no problem'",
        "Be enthusiastic about helping",
        "Keep things light and fun"
    ]
)
```

#### Consistency Rules

Always include:

1. **What to do** - Positive instructions
2. **What not to do** - Boundaries
3. **Edge cases** - How to handle unusual situations

```python
agent.prompt_add_section(
    "Boundaries",
    bullets=[
        "Never share internal policies or pricing formulas",
        "Don't make commitments about delivery dates",
        "If unsure, say you'll transfer to a specialist",
        "Never argue with a customer"
    ]
)
```

### 5. Prompt Templates (15 min)

#### Standard Agent Template

```python
def configure_agent(agent, company_name, role_description):
    """Standard prompt template."""

    # Identity
    agent.prompt_add_section(
        "Role",
        f"You are a voice assistant for {company_name}. {role_description}"
    )

    # Behavior
    agent.prompt_add_section(
        "Communication Style",
        bullets=[
            "Keep responses brief - this is a phone call",
            "Use natural, conversational language",
            "Confirm important details by repeating them",
            "Ask one question at a time"
        ]
    )

    # Boundaries
    agent.prompt_add_section(
        "Limitations",
        bullets=[
            "If you cannot help, offer to transfer to a human",
            "Never guess - say when you don't know something",
            "Don't discuss topics unrelated to your role"
        ]
    )

    # Process
    agent.prompt_add_section(
        "Call Flow",
        bullets=[
            "Greet the caller warmly",
            "Ask how you can help",
            "Handle their request or transfer appropriately",
            "Confirm satisfaction before ending"
        ]
    )
```

#### Using the Template

```python
agent = AgentBase(name="support-agent")

configure_agent(
    agent,
    company_name="TechCorp",
    role_description="You help customers with software questions and account issues."
)
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Too Much Information

**Bad:**

```python
agent.prompt_add_section("Role", """
You are an AI assistant created by Acme Corp in 2024. Acme Corp was founded
in 1985 by John Smith and has grown to 50,000 employees across 30 countries.
Our mission is to deliver exceptional customer experiences through innovative
technology solutions. You should embody our core values of integrity,
excellence, and customer-first thinking. Our products include...
[500 more words]
""")
```

**Good:**

```python
agent.prompt_add_section("Role", "You are a support agent for Acme Corp.")
```

### 2. Contradictory Instructions

**Bad:**

```python
agent.prompt_add_section("Style", "Be very brief and concise.")
agent.prompt_add_section("Detail", "Provide thorough, detailed explanations.")
```

### 3. Forgetting Voice Context

**Bad:**

```python
agent.prompt_add_section("Help", "Direct users to click the blue button.")
```

They can't click anything - it's a phone call!
