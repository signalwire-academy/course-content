## Objectives

- Install the SignalWire Agents SDK
- Configure development environment
- Verify installation with CLI tools

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ installed
- Terminal/command line access
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

---

## Exercise 1: Create Working Directory

Create a dedicated directory for training:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/signalwire-training
cd ~/signalwire-training
```

**Checkpoint:** You should be in the `signalwire-training` directory.

---

## Exercise 2: Create Virtual Environment

Set up an isolated Python environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

**Checkpoint:** Your prompt should show `(.venv)` prefix.

---

## Exercise 3: Install SDK

Install the SignalWire Agents SDK:

```bash
pip install signalwire-agents
```

Wait for installation to complete.

**Checkpoint:** No errors in installation output.

---

## Exercise 4: Verify Core Import

Test that the SDK loads correctly:

```bash
python -c "from signalwire_agents import AgentBase; print('SUCCESS: AgentBase imported')"
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
SUCCESS: AgentBase imported
```

---

## Exercise 5: Verify CLI Tools

Test the command-line tools:

```bash
# Test swaig-test
swaig-test --help

# Test sw-agent-init
sw-agent-init --help
```

**Checkpoint:** Both commands show help text without errors.

---

## Exercise 6: Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file for configuration:

```bash
cat > .env << 'EOF'
# SignalWire Credentials (fill in later)
SIGNALWIRE_SPACE_NAME=
SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_ID=
SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN=

# Development Settings
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=3000

# Authentication
AUTH_USER=signalwire
AUTH_PASS=training123
EOF
```

**Checkpoint:** File `.env` exists with template content.

---

## Exercise 7: Create Test Agent

Create a simple test agent:

```bash
cat > test_agent.py << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Test agent for environment verification."""

from signalwire_agents import AgentBase

agent = AgentBase(name="test-agent")

agent.prompt_add_section("Role", "You are a test agent.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Environment setup successful!")
    print("Agent name:", agent.name)
EOF
```

Run it:

```bash
python test_agent.py
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
Environment setup successful!
Agent name: test-agent
```

---

## Exercise 8: Test SWML Generation

Use swaig-test to verify agent output:

```bash
swaig-test test_agent.py --dump-swml
```

**Expected Output:** JSON document with SWML structure including your prompt.

---

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Virtual environment created and activated
- [ ] SDK installed without errors
- [ ] `AgentBase` imports successfully
- [ ] `swaig-test --help` works
- [ ] `sw-agent-init --help` works
- [ ] `.env` file created
- [ ] Test agent runs
- [ ] SWML generation works

---

## Troubleshooting

### "python: command not found"

Try `python3` instead of `python`.

### "No module named signalwire_agents"

Ensure virtual environment is activated (you see `(.venv)` in prompt).

### "Permission denied"

On Unix, you may need: `chmod +x test_agent.py`

### swaig-test not found

Ensure you're in the activated virtual environment where SDK was installed.

---

## Summary

You have successfully:

1. Created a dedicated training directory
2. Set up an isolated Python environment
3. Installed the SignalWire Agents SDK
4. Verified all components work correctly

**Next:** Module 1.2 - Your First Agent
